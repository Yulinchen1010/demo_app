## Working with GitHub

If you want to collaborate through GitHub, the typical workflow looks like this:

1. **Clone or sync the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YourOrg/demo_app.git
   cd demo_app
   git pull # keep the local clone up to date
   ```
2. **Create a feature branch for your work**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-task
   ```
3. **Make changes locally** using your preferred editor (for example VS Code),
   run tests, and verify the app.
4. **Stage and commit the changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git status
   git add path/to/changed/files
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   ```
5. **Push the branch to GitHub** and open a Pull Request (PR):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-task
   ```
6. **Create the PR on GitHub**, request a review from your teammate, address
   feedback, and merge once checks pass.

Repeat the cycle for each bug fix or new feature so the `main` branch stays
stable and reviewable.
